"""Document classification — its own step, its own confidence, its own gate.

Per spec gap #1, classification is deliberately **not** part of extraction:
a misrouted document must fail loudly, not produce a high-confidence
extraction against the wrong schema.

- ``classify_document()`` returns ``{document_type, confidence}`` as a
  structured result. The backend is Claude structured output when an API key
  is set; otherwise a deterministic keyword classifier with the same
  contract and the same confidence gate.
- Below ``classification_min_confidence`` (0.75), the result is set to
  ``UNCLASSIFIED`` and routed to human triage. It is never guessed at a real
  type and never passed to extraction.
- Scanned PDFs/pages go through Tesseract OCR first (free, MVP-grade — the
  explicit lower-accuracy trade-off stated in the spec).

Every decision emits a Langfuse-style trace with the confidence visible.
