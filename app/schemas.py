"""Per-asset-class Pydantic extraction schemas, routed by document type.

Phase 4 ships the Loan pipeline end to end. The remaining schemas (Sukuk,
Equity, Real Asset, Fund Interest) are defined now so the routing table covers
every document type today — their extractor functions land in Phase 6; the
schema shapes are the contract.

Every schema maps into ``Document.extracted_data`` through the *explicit*
``extraction_result_to_data()`` function below (spec gap #2): the typed
Pydantic object is ``model_dump()``'d and the schema name + version are
stored alongside the payload, so the JSON field is never an implicit,
unversioned bag.
